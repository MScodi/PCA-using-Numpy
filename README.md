# Intro
Principal Component Analyis is basically a statistical procedure to convert a set of observation of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables.
Each of the principal components is chosen in such a way so that it would describe most of the still available variance and all these principal components are orthogonal to each other. In all principal components first principal component has maximum variance.

Uses of PCA:

It is used to find inter-relation between variables in the data.
It is used to interpret and visualize data.
As number of variables are decreasing it makes further analysis simpler.
